There has been a lot of stuff going on recently, so I am behind on everything.  We are moving to SF in 2 weeks.  EEK!  And also, I got engaged!  Wheee!  Life is wonderful and crazy.  But I don't have any photos to prove that point just yet.  So, here are some from the past few months that I have been staring for a very long time but not editing.
