My family keeps asking me if I took any pictures that have people that we know in them, and I understand their frustrations...but to be honest I didn't really take that many.  These are the ones I like.  This really is the last Barcelona post.  Woo!

  I like taking pictures of Matt taking pictures.  It's fun.

  These people I do not know, but sometimes the camera just focuses on what it feels like focusing on.

  This is Matt's judging face.  And it was warranted.  There was a guy walking around this eatary playing the obo with a boom box for back up music.  It was slightly uncomfortable.

  Matt is excited about pasta.  And rightfully so.
