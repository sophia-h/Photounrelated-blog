These are the last pictures I think I will post from Barcelona that are of things and not people.  This is a total hodgepodge of stuff that really has no order or theme.  Just a bunch of lovely things.  The vacation was a shit ton of fun.

  ATL.  Planes.

  My first veiw of Barcelona when I stepped off the plane at 8am.  Jet lag!

  Boats at the port.

  Wine, my feet, and the winding stairs that lead up to our apartment.

  There were a lot of strange and wonderful art things scattered in back alleys all over the city.  This is one of them.

  Left: This is a building right outside the Dali museum.  Right: Just a place we ate some breakfast

  This is the Dali portrait of Mae West.  You had to climb a staircase to get to a huge magnifiying glass through which you could take a picture such as this.

  This is a wall.  And I love it, but not many others feel the same.  Whatever.
